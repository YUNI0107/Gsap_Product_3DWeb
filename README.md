**Ray marching technique** ([Reference](https://medium.com/@nabilnymansour/ray-marching-in-three-js-66b03e3a6af2))\
Using the Ray Marching technique, a fused sphere effect is created and rendered on a Plane in a separate layer. Two cameras are used to ensure the effect always appears behind the model.

**postprocessing** ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing))\
Apply the SelectiveBloomEffect in Bloom to ensure the effect working on a transparent background Canvas.
